# Calculator Web Application For FreeCodeCamp

## About
This is one of the Zipline projects for FreeCodeCamp. The goal was to make a fully functional calculator 

Project comes with a codepen preview: http://codepen.io/tyrantwarship/pen/WreQyw
![Preview](./preview.png?raw=true)

##### To-Add:
* ~~C function that only clears the buffer~~
* ~~Add Square root funcionality~~
* ~~Add negative number functionality~~
* ~~Add link to the codepen project once created~~
* More complex operation chaining
* Decimal Value input (output works)

##### To-Fix:
* ~~Divide and Multiply Operations change the stored value to 0 if they arent the initial operation~~
* ~~You can change the operation instead of hitting = and it will replace the previously selectec operation~~
* ~~After hitting '=' if you hit a number it appends to the result of the previous operation~~
* ~~Fix bug where using square root on a number that hasnt been processed by an operation returns 0 (due to stored_value being empty)~~
