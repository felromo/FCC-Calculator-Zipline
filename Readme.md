# Calculator Web Application For FreeCodeCamp

## About
This is one of the Zipline projects for FreeCodeCamp. The goal was to make a fully functional calculator 

Project comes with a codepen preview: placeholder

##### To-Add:
* C function that only clears the buffer
* Add Square root funcionality
* Add negative number functionality

##### To-Fix:
* ~~Divide and Multiply Operations change the stored value to 0 if they arent the initial operation~~
* You can change the operation instead of hitting = and it will replace the previously selectec operation 
* Add link to the codepen project once created
* ~~After hitting '=' if you hit a number it appends to the result of the previous operation~~
